#### Introduction to metrology
*measurand* - This is the physical quantity being subject to measurement.
*Measurement* - this is the process of comparing quantitatively an unknown magnitude with a predefined standard.
*testing* this is the ==determination of the characteristics== of a product according to ==certain procedures== or requirements.
*Calibration* - This is the ==setting== or correcting of a ==measuring device== or a base level by adjusting it to ==match a known value.== 

*Tracability chain* - this is an unbroken chain of comparison all having stated uncertainties.
*Uncertainties* - This is a quantitative measure of the quality of the measurement result, enabling the meaurement result to be compared with other results.
*Errors* - Are classified into two categories:
	- *Systematic errors* - these are associated with a particular measuring instrument of experimental technique
	- *Random errors* - These are due to lack of observer precision.

#### Standard of measurements
A standard is a value which is setup and established by an authority as a rule of measurement of a quantity.

*Derived units* are unites that are gotten from base units such as area and power.

*Line standard* - when the length being measured is expressed as the distance ==between parallel lines== then it is called the __Line standard__.
Characteristics of line standards:-
- it is difficult to take full advantage of this accuracy.
- a scale is quick and easy to use over a wide range of measurements.
- the wear on the leading ends result in undersizing.
- scales can be subjected to parallax effect.
- scales are not suitalble for close tolerance length measurements.
- The length is affected by temprature

*End standards* - the distance is measured between ==two parallel faces==.
Characteristics of end standards:
- End standards are highly accurate.
- they are time consuming
- they are subject to wear on the measuring faces.
- End standards have a built in datum because their faces are flat.
- they are not subject to parallax effect.
- the blocks might be comined to produce any length
- the accuracy is affected by temprature.

*Wavelength standards* - This is done through the use of light to measure.
Characteristics of wavelength standards:
- Lenght does not change
- Can be easily reproduced if destroyed
- Can be used to make measurements with higher accuracy.
- wavelength standards are reproduced consistently at any time and any place.

### Measurement and inspection instruments.
Measuring instruments are usually specified by their metrological properties.
1. *Scale range* - The ==interval== between the minimun and maximum value a scale an instrument can measure.
2. *Instrument range* - The total range of values an instrument is capable of measuring.
3. *Scale spacing* - It is the distance between the axis of two adjacent ==graduations==.
4. *Scale division value* - represents the smallest incremental unit or difference between two consecutive markings.
5. *Sensitivity* - the property of a measuring equipment to respond to changes in the measured quantity.
6. *Accuracy* - differnece between the reading of the instrument and the actual value of the dimension.
7. *Precision* - the ability of an instrument to measure a quantity in a consistent manner.
8. *Linearity* - this the accuracy of the reading over an instrument full working range.

### Limits, fits and limit gauges
*Shaft*- this is a member that fits into another member.
*Hole*- This is the member that houses or fits the shaft
*Basic size* - the size about which the limits of a particular fit are fixed.
*Zero line* - This is a straight line to which deviations are reffered to.
*Tolerance* - is the permissable variation of a size.
*Deviation* - This is the difference between the size and the basic size.
*Allowance* -  the difference between the high limit of the shaft and the low limit of the shaft.
*Fit* is the retationship existing between two mating arts.
Fits can be divided into three types
> clearance fit - in which the shaft is always smaller than the hole.
> 	- minimum clearance - difference between the minimum size of the whole and teh maximum size of the whole
> 	- maximun clearance - the largest hole smallest rod
> Transision fit - where the shaft can be bigger or smaller than the hole it fits in, therefore interference is possible.
> Interference fit - The shaft is always bigger than the whole.

__Unilateral limits__ are one which tolerances vary in one direction while __Bilateral limits__ varies in both directions.

#### Basis of fits
*Hole basis*
The size of the whole is kept constant
*Shaft basis*
The size of the shaft is kept constant.

- Ring gauges
- Snap gauges
- Feeler gauges

*Plug gauges*
The have two ends one is ==Go== and the other ==No go==. If the hole is within the limits the go will go into the hole and teh no go will stay out.![[Pasted image 20250504214506.png]]
*Ring gauge*
These are mainly used to check the diameter of chafts having a central hole. They are two rings that are go for the upper limit and no go for the lower limit. The go ring will pass and the no go ring will not pass.![[Pasted image 20250504214928.png]]
*Snap gauge*
These are used for chacking externa dimensions. They are two.
Double ended snap gauge
	 The go andvil is the lower limit and the NOGO anvil is the upper limit of the shaft.
Progressive snap gauge
	GO anvil at the front and NOGO anvil at the rear.
![[Pasted image 20250504215444.png]]

__Wear allowance__ Measurement of GO gauges rub against the surface of parts in inspection this they lose their initial size. Wear allowance (5%) is added to the nomical dimension of the GO plug.

- supceptible for wear
- cannot handle finer quality jobs
- requires frequenct checking of gauge dimensions.


### Interferometry
Light sources for interferometry should be monochromatic in nature and the same amplitude.
*Interferometers* are optical instruments used for measuring flatness and deternining minute differences in length by direct refrence to the wavelength of light.
*Laser interferometry*
The use of laser allows for longer distance measuring.
![[Pasted image 20250504223110.png]]
A laser interferometer works by splitting a laser beam into two identical beams using a beam splitter. One beam travels to a fixed mirror, while the other travels to a mirror that moves with the object being measured. After reflecting off their respective mirrors, the beams return and recombine. Because light behaves like a wave, the two beams can interfere with each other—either reinforcing or canceling out—depending on the difference in the distances they traveled. This interference pattern changes as the moving mirror shifts position, allowing extremely precise measurement of distance changes, often down to a fraction of the wavelength of light.

<u>Uses</u>
- used in the alignment of large machines
- used to calibrate precision machines and measuing devices
- used to check machine setups
