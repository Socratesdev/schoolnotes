*Milling* is the machining of a surface using a cutter which has a which has a number of teeth.
*Milling machine* is a machine in which metal is removed by means of a revolving cutter with many teeth each tooth having a cutting edge that removes metal from the workpiece.
*Intermittent cutting* - equally spaced pheripheral teeth come in contact with the workspace and machines the workpiece.

There are Two types of milling processes.
Upmilling(conventional) and downmilling(climb) process.
![[Pasted image 20250508051838.png]]

*Upmilling process*
The work is fed opposite the cutters tangential velocity. Each tooth starts at zero depth of cut and gradually increases until it reaches the maximum value as the tooth leaves the cut.
<u>Advantages</U>
- The shock load on each tooth is minimised
<u>Disadvantages</u>
- It requires more secure clamping of the workpiece
- it is difficult to pour coolant
- worse surface finish
- the surface may become slightly wavy.

*Downmilling process*
The feed is fed in the same direction as that of the cutter tangential velocity. Downmilling is used on materials that ar efree of scale and other surface imperfections that can damage the cutters.
<u>Advantages</u>
- Permits lower clamping force
- Produces better finishing
- coolant is fed easily.

##### Cutting speed, feed and depth of cut.
Cutting speed is given by:
![[Pasted image 20250508100738.png]]
Just the circumfrence multiplied by the r.p.m and change it to meters from milimeters.

Selection of cutting speed depends on:
- Properties of the material being cut

- Number of cutter teeth 
- Feed
- Depth of cut
- Use of coolant

Feed is the rate at which work is fed into the cutter.
feed per minute = fed per rev * cutter speed.

*Depth of cut* is the thinkness of the layer of material removed in one pass of the work under the cutter.
*Material removal rate* is the volume of metal removed in unit time.

## Grinding
*Grinding* is a metal cutting performed be means of a rotating abrasive tool called a grinding wheel.
Can be broadly classified into rough of precision grinding.

Grinding according to the type of surface can be classified into:
![[Pasted image 20250508103118.png]]
1. *External cylindrical grinding* - this produces a straight or tapered surface on a workspace.
2. *Internal cylindrical grinding* - Produces internal cylindrical holes and tapers. Work is chucked and rotaed as the grinding cylinder rotates.
3. *Surface grinding* - produce flat accurate surfaces and can be carried out on all materials.
	The main elements of a typical surface-grinding machine are:
	- Base - This is a heavy casting to ensure rigidity and houses the hydraulic pump and fliud reservior.
	- Column - Carries the wheelhead at its top end and contains the motor and belt drive.
	- Wheelhead - The wheelhead carries the wheelspindle.
	- Saddle - Placed on top of the base an provides horizontal movement.
	- Table - guided by the slideway and is manually operated.
![[Pasted image 20250508102920.png]]

4. *Form grinding* - Special shaped grinding wheel to grind a custom surface.

<u>Advantages of grinding process</u>
1. It is possible to achieve very accurate dimensions.
2. It is the only method of removing material from hardended materials
3. It is possible to achieve extremey smooth surface.
4. Complex profiles can be produced accurately. 
5. No marks are made as a result of feeding.
6. Little pressure is required thus safeguarding the workpiece.


###### Special features of grinding process

The wheel is self sharpening as the worn out grains are removed by fracture exposing new grains.
Load acting on individial cutting grains is non-uniform.
Geomtry of the grain is highly randomand tome of contact is small. High temps are experienced.

###### Size and specifications of grinding machines
- The largest workpiece that can be held
- Width of the table
- Maximum traverse of the table
- Wheel diameter
- Height of the grinding head
- Power of the grinder.

![[Pasted image 20250508104042.png]]

##### Centerless grinding
It defers from other cylindrical process as the workpiece is not mechanically constrained.

Centerless grinding is a machining process used to remove material from the outside of a cylindrical workpiece without the need for centering the workpiece on a spindle. Instead of being held between centers, the workpiece is supported by a work rest blade and is rotated between two wheels: a high-speed grinding wheel and a slower-speed regulating wheel. The regulating wheel controls the rotation and feed of the workpiece through the grinding area. 

This method is highly efficient for mass production and is ideal for producing precise cylindrical parts with tight tolerances, such as pins, rods, and bushings. Centerless grinding is commonly used in industries like automotive, aerospace, and manufacturing due to its speed, accuracy, and ability to process small or complex parts continuously.

<u>Advantages</u>
○ a. High production rate 
○ b. No need for work clamping 
○ c. Excellent surface finish 
○ d. Ideal for small or slender parts

##### Grinding wheel
Its performece is usually evaliated in terms of the grinding ratio defined as:
![[Pasted image 20250508105023.png]]

The wheel parameters that influence performance are:
1. *Abrasive material* - The material the grinding wheel consist of.
2. *Abrasive size* - represents the openning per linear inch.
3. *Bond* - used to hold the abrasive material together
4. *Grade*- This is the strength of the bond holding the abrasive grains in place.
	Hard grade is high strength. When grinding soft materials the grains dont need to dull quickly therefore no need to release it.
5. *Structure* - The grains are spaced to leave smaller or larger air spaces between them.

*Guarding* - Due to its fragile nature, it is posible for the wheel to burst. A guard consisting of a plate which encloses the front of the wheel to protect the operator should the wheel burst.

#### Depth of cut, machining time and MRR
Depth is given by:
![[Pasted image 20250508110239.png]]
Pheripheral speed of a job is:
![[Pasted image 20250508110347.png]]
When the grinding wheel rotates in opposite direction to each other the citting speed is given by:
![[Pasted image 20250508110527.png]]


### Honing
*Honing* is a grinding process in whcih very little material is removed and is primarily used to remove marls on the surfaces left by the previous operations.
The honing tool is given a slow reciprocating motion as it rotates resulting in rapid removal of stock and generates a straight and smooth finish.
A metal frame that holds the abrasive sticks during honing operations is known as the honing tool.

There are two types of hones:
- Internal hones
- External hones

2. Gears which have shoulders cant be cut by hobbing.

## Questions
*Types of precision grinding*
- Internal grining
- External grinding
- Cylindrical grinding
- Surface grinding.

**Dressing a grinding wheel** is important because:
1. **Restores sharpness** – Removes worn abrasives to expose fresh cutting edges.
2. **Maintains shape** – Keeps the wheel in its correct form for accurate grinding.
3. **Improves efficiency** – Enhances cutting performance and reduces burn or chatter.
4. **Prevents loading** – Clears debris and material buildup from the wheel surface.

  Importance of Cross-Hatch Pattern in Internal Combustion Engines

The cross-hatch pattern in engine cylinders (created by honing) is vital because it:

1. **Retains oil** – Helps hold lubrication for piston movement.
    
2. **Promotes ring seating** – Assists piston rings in sealing against the cylinder wall.
    
3. **Reduces wear** – Minimizes friction and extends engine life.
    
4. **Improves performance** – Ensures efficient combustion and reduces blow-by.
    
 Four Defects Corrected by Honing

1. **Taper** – Difference in diameter from top to bottom of the bore.
    
2. **Out-of-roundness** – Bore is not perfectly circular.
    
3. **Scoring/scratches** – Removes surface damage.
    
4. **Poor surface finish** – Smooths the cylinder for better ring sealing.
    

#### **Parts:**

1. **Central Computer** – Stores and manages all CNC programs.
    
2. **CNC Machines** – Individual machine tools connected to the network.
    
3. **Communication Network** – Wired or wireless link for data transfer.
    
4. **Remote Terminals** – Used to monitor or control machine access remotely.

 **How It Works:**
- The **central computer** sends part programs to CNC machines as needed.
    
- Machines execute programs without storing them permanently.
    
- Operators can request programs or send feedback to the central system.
    
- Real-time updates and monitoring improve production efficiency and coordination.
